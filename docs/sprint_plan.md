# Sprint Plan - April 2024 (2 weeks)

## Sprint Goal

Improve system performance and enhance OpenSCAD model capabilities while maintaining security
standards. This sprint focuses on the most critical performance bottlenecks and completing the
OpenSCAD feature set.

## Selected Items

### Priority 1: Performance Optimization

1. **Implement 4 CPU Core Support**

    - Story Points: 5
    - Tasks:
        - Modify server configuration for multi-core support
        - Implement load balancing across cores
        - Performance testing and monitoring
    - Dependencies: None
    - Risk: Potential service disruption during deployment

2. **WebSocket Connection Optimization**
    - Story Points: 3
    - Tasks:
        - Implement connection pooling
        - Add reconnection logic
        - Optimize message queuing
    - Dependencies: None
    - Risk: May affect existing real-time functionality

### Priority 2: OpenSCAD Enhancement

3. **Add Color Support to OpenSCAD Models**
    - Story Points: 5
    - Tasks:
        - Implement color parameter handling
        - Update rendering engine
        - Add color picker UI
    - Dependencies: Existing OpenSCAD integration
    - Risk: Compatibility with existing models

### Priority 3: Security

4. **API Rate Limiting Implementation**
    - Story Points: 3
    - Tasks:
        - Design rate limiting strategy
        - Implement rate limiting middleware
        - Add monitoring alerts
    - Dependencies: None
    - Risk: May affect legitimate high-volume users

### Supporting Tasks

5. **Performance Monitoring Setup**
    - Story Points: 2
    - Tasks:
        - Configure additional Grafana dashboards
        - Set up performance alerts
    - Dependencies: Existing monitoring infrastructure
    - Risk: Low

## Total Story Points: 18

## Dependencies

- All team members need access to testing environment
- OpenSCAD documentation and API references
- Performance testing tools

## Risks and Mitigation

1. **Performance Impact**
    - Risk: Service disruption during core optimization
    - Mitigation: Deploy during low-traffic hours, have rollback plan
2. **Technical Complexity**
    - Risk: OpenSCAD color implementation more complex than estimated
    - Mitigation: Early prototype testing, technical spike if needed

## Definition of Done

- All code reviewed and merged to main branch
- Unit tests passing with >80% coverage
- Performance tests show improvement over baseline
- Documentation updated
- No critical security vulnerabilities
- Successful deployment to staging environment
- Product Owner sign-off
- Monitoring alerts configured
- User documentation updated where applicable

## Success Metrics

- CPU utilization reduced by 20%
- WebSocket connection stability improved to 99.9%
- OpenSCAD color rendering working in all major browsers
- Rate limiting successfully preventing abuse
- No regression in existing functionality

## Sprint Planning Notes

- Daily standups at 10:00 AM
- Mid-sprint review on day 7
- Technical debt addressed within each task
- Performance testing required before any deployment

This sprint focuses on technical improvements that will provide a better foundation for future
feature development while completing the OpenSCAD feature set.
